**Git Flow**

A set of guidelines developers can follow when using version control.

Referred to as branching model.

**Git FLow Working

•	Works with the help of central repository.
•	Developers can clone the central repository and can work locally.
•	They can push their branches into the central repository.
•	Two branches used to record project history.

1.	Master
2.	Develop
                 
•	Develop serves as an integration branch for features.
•	Master branch stores the official release history.

Feature Branches :

•	New development (new features, non-emergency bug fixes) are built in feature branches.
•	Feature branch uses develop as its parent branch.
•	When feature is complete, it gets merged back into develop branch when they are ready for release.
•	It shouldn’t interact directly with the master branch.
